#헥사고날 아키텍쳐

##영어 요약
- Hexagonal architecture is an alternative to the traditional three-tier model of software architecture.
- It uses dependency injection and abstract classes to prevent highly coupled layers.
- Hexagonal architecture uses ports and adapters for inputs and outputs of an application, creating a decoupled design. 
A port is an abstraction that defines how your application interacts with other systems. It provides a custom interface to your app while decoupling its logic from external sources, such as a database. Adapters act as converters that take the output from the port and transform it into a format usable by external sources.
- Hexagonal architecture has two sides: input and output, which are driven and driving, respectively.
- The hexagon shape is used to show the inputs and outputs, being a convenient and aesthetic form.
- Hexagons can be connected together, forming a honeycomb-like structure, or split into different domains.
